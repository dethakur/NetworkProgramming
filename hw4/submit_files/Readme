Same command to run the program - 
1) make
2) ./deploy_app tour_deva_kau arp_deva_kau
3) ./start_app arp_deva_kau
4) Running tour -> 
On all but one VM run -> ./tour_deva_kau
On the VM not run above, run -> ./tour_deva_kau vm1 vm2 vm4 vm5 vm6 vm3 vm8 vm9 vm10 vm6 vm7 vm8 vm4 vm2 vm7

Before running tour , arp should be running in all the machines.

The tour.c does areq() method call to get data from the cache. This invokes the method process_frame() in arp.c. 
If the IP address is not in cache , a broadcast request is sent to find the IP-Cache mapping and is saved in static data strucutre
named arp_cache_details.

In Tour.c , each time an IP is invoked for the first time , it joins multicast on IP 224.220.108.121 and port 1987.
It sends ping to previous IP in  method sendping(). Duplicate pings are not sent. This method is invoked my a thread 
which is called every one second.

When the tour ends send_multicast() is called which sends multicast to all the IPs which had joined the multicast address.

In logs prints like [ARP-REQ] or [ARP-RESP] will show the query done to ARP from tour.
