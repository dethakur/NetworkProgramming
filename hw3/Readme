Each client opens a temporary Unix Datagram socket, which is akin to a port in TCP.
The client then asks the user for an input VM (value can be vm1 to vm10) which will cause a GetTime request to be sent to the server running on that VM. 
The client request timeout period is 2 seconds.

Example of client input below
*** Choose a vm (vm1-vm10) ***
vm3

The server opens a Unix Datagram socket with the name /tmp/deva_kau which is used by the ODR process to communicate with the same.
